1. Explain how to build stateful class components.

    A. Building components with stateful logic  means keeping track of changing data within components using state. data can be stored and updated and rendered.

2. Describe the different phases of the component lifecycle.

    A. 3 main phases Mounting. Updating, Unmounting:

        *Mounting - Means putting elements in the DOM:
            4 built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:
                1.constructor() - called before anything else when component is initiated; set up the initial state and other initial values. 
                2.getDerivedStateFromProps()
                3.render() - method is required and will always be called
                4.componentDidMount() - method is called after the component is rendered

        *Updating - Whenever there is a change in the component's state or props:
            5 built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated
                1.getDerivedStateFromProps()
                2.shouldComponentUpdate()
                3.render()
                4.getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
                5.componentDidUpdate() - method is called after the update has been rendered in the DOM

        *Unmounting - When a component is removed from the DOM:
            1 built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted
                1.componentWillUnmount()
